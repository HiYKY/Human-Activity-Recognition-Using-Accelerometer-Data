# Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Accelerometer-Data
Part of the Multimedia University's Faculty of Information and Science Technology (FIST) Final Year Project for session 2019/2020 

The proposed model use a combination of CNN and Bidirectional LSTM.
Train and test using two dataset (WISDM and UCI)

The model is used as a deep feature extractor to extract deep feature (trainable weights) to be input into WEKA.
Different classifiers are tested and tabulated.
